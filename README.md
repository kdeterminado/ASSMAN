Short for "Asset Manager"

A simple standalone asset manager for games and such. Just copy `assman.h` and `assman.c` into your project and add it to your makefile or whatever it is you're using.

# API:

- **Typedefs**
  
  - `void *(*AssLoaderFn)(const char *path,  void *data)`: This is the signature for the loader function you will have to provide `AssMan_load()`. You can wrap an existing library's load function.
  
  - `void  (*AssReleaseFn)(void      *asset, void *data)`: This is the signature for the unloader function you will have to provide `AssMan_load()`. You can wrap an existing library's unload function.

- **Functions**
  
  - `void *AssMan_load( const char *path, AssLoaderFn loader, void *load_data, AssReleaseFn releaser, void *release_data)`: Loads a file from disc if it's not allocated already, otherwise, just returns the currently allocated resource. It will load the file located at `path` using function `loader` with `load_data` as its second argument, and pass to the loaded `Asset` function `releaser` and `release_data` to use later when it needs to be unloaded from memory.
  
  - `void  AssMan_release(const char *path)`: Releases a resource if it's no longer in use anywhere else, otherwise, it decrements the refcount.

- `void  AssMan_clear(  void)`: Clears the entire manager of all assets.
